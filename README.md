# [Sentiment Analysis - NLP Hotel Reviews](https://github.com/cristhianc001/Analisis-Sentimientos-Hoteles/tree/main)

## Overview:

This sentiment analysis project was carried out by performing tasks inherent to data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning engineering. Various data sources such as Google Maps, Yelp, and hotels.com were utilized, followed by data cleaning and loading into a data warehouse. Additionally, an incremental query and loading process were implemented, complete with the necessary data functions and orchestrator.

![](https://github.com/cristhianc001/Analisis-Sentimientos-Hoteles/blob/main/img/flujo_de_datos.jpeg)

The project was implemented on the Google Cloud Platform. Python libraries such as Streamlit, Seaborn, and Matplotlib were used for visualizations, and a Power BI dashboard was developed. Furthermore, several natural language processing models were implemented to extract sentiment from reviews. Lastly, the OpenAI API (chat-GPT) was integrated to run the model with higher accuracy.

# [🛰️ Telecommunications Analysis in Argentina - EDA Report 🛰️](https://github.com/HugoSalazarS/DataAnalysisInternetArgentina)

## Overview:

This project encompasses an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted for a telecommunications service provider. The primary goal of this analysis was to gain insights into the behavior of the telecommunications sector at the national level. The aim was to provide valuable information to enhance service quality, identify growth opportunities, and propose tailored solutions for potential clients.

![](https://github.com/HugoSalazarS/DataAnalysisInternetArgentina/raw/main/images/compbandas.png)

The project includes the following key components:

EDA Report in Jupyter Notebook: A comprehensive EDA report has been generated in a Jupyter Notebook. This report delves into the dataset to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and correlations. By utilizing various data visualization techniques, the analysis sheds light on the industry's dynamics, customer preferences, and potential areas for improvement.

Power BI Dashboard Development: Alongside the EDA report, a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard has been created. This dashboard visually presents the findings of the analysis, providing a user-friendly interface to explore data insights and key performance indicators. It empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and respond proactively to market demands.

![](https://github.com/HugoSalazarS/DataAnalysisInternetArgentina/blob/main/images/db.png)

By combining the EDA report and Power BI dashboard, this project equips the telecommunications company with valuable information to enhance their services, capitalize on growth opportunities, and cater to the unique needs of potential customers. The insights gained from the analysis pave the way for data-driven strategies and improved customer experiences, driving the company's success in a competitive market landscape.

# [📊 Data Cleaning, Insights Discovery, and Visualization Project 📊](https://github.com/HugoSalazarS/Data-Analysis/)
